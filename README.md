The app fosters community by allowing users to see, like, comment on, and compare answers with friends and others on the platform.

## Concept

Imagine an app that bridges the gap between "just saying hi" and truly knowing someone. With **Prompt**, each daily prompt is designed to reveal something unique about you, creating opportunities for connection and conversation among friends, acquaintances, and even strangers. The app emphasizes:

- **Daily Engagement:** Answer one thought-provoking prompt every day.
- **Community Interaction:** Like and comment on others' responses.
- **Curated Social Experience:** Explore trending answers, most liked responses, and even discover the friends you most closely resemble.

## Features

- **Daily Prompts:** Receive a daily question that is interesting, identity-revealing, and balancedâ€”not too deep, yet meaningful.
- **Answer Sharing:** After answering, see what others have written. Engage with their responses by liking or commenting.
- **Trending Answers:** Explore four tabs:
  - **Global Trends:** See the most common themes across the entire app.
  - **Friend Trends:** View the most common themes among your own social circle.
  - **Global Favorites:** View the most liked answers across the entire app.
  - **Friend Favorites:** View the most liked answers among your own social circle.
- **AI-Driven Friend Matching:**
  - Automatically identify and highlight friends (or users) who share similar responses to yours, displaying a top 3 most similar answers.
  - At the end of each month, see a summary of the top 3 people you have the most in common with, based on your answers.
- **For You Page:** A dynamic feed of random answers curated to inspire and entertain.
- **Common Trends & Uniqueness Metrics:**
